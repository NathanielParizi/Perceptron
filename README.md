# Perceptron
Training AND/OR logic to a single-layered perceptron.

The Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.
Binary classifiers can determine when an input represents a vector of numbers
or belongs to a specific class. It is a classification algorithm that can
make predictions on problems which are linearly separable such as AND/OR logic.
